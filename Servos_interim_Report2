Project Description:

Using a html interface we want to control a raspberry pi camera to take still photos and rotate the camera with servos attached to it.

Work Completed:
Hosted test web interfaces for video streaming
Confirmed accurate post and get requests interact smoothly with Python
Solder microcontroller to servos
Installed libraries onto pi for servo control
Began creating schematic for camera holder

To-Do:
Create camera holder
Finalize web interface controls, specifically, video record button and possible motion detection
Finalize servo design/orientation

Individual Accomplishments:

Contributed to the schematics for the camera holder

Emil:
 
Tested camera capabilities
Hosted initial test server
Made HTML code for camera livestream

Cory:

Hosted new server
Made HTML code for camera livestream
Drafted schematics for the camera holder

Personally, I have found the process of understanding just how to correctly send data from a client to a server and back to the client
a useful and exciting procedure. I look forward to continuing to use this very same technology in other projects. 

Although my code may not be the most efficient for client server communication, I have found that I have something to work with and 
the video camera doesn't seem to lag when combined with
