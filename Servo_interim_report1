Project Description
Using a html interface we want to control a raspberry pi camera to take still photos and rotate the camera with servos attached to it.

Work Completed
Hosted test web interfaces for video streaming
Solder microcontroller to servos
Installed libraries onto pi for servo control
Began creating schematic for camera holder

To-Do
Create camera holder
Finalize web interface controls
Finalize servo design
Stabilize server-client communication
Add style for the html page

Individual Accomplishments

Cory
Hosted new server
Made HTML code for camera livestream
Drafted schematics for the camera holder

We still have a ways to go, but since our web interface has the ability to send slier data, 
we are feeling optimistic about our success in sending this data to python. We have a rough sketch 
of how are boom will go with our servos, but we need to put the materials together still.
